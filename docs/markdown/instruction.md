## Focus on the stage of how to teach knowledge clearly
If the author has a little knowledge as only looks at the sky in a well, then he cannot explain the problem clearly in any way. Therefore, the first stage has spent a lot of time on experimental accumulation, and finally get a glimpse of the whole picture, and enters the second stage. In this stage, in addition to continuing to accumulate experiments, the focus is on how to teach knowledge. It is also the motivation for communicating with partners in an interactive community in the process of finishing the book rather than launching a community after finishing the book.

## Target audience
The title of 'Urban spatial data analysis method——python language implementation' reflects the principal direction of the research, such as urban planning, landscape architecture, architecture, ecological planning, and geographic information.  For readers, including college students and researchers, workgroup, are not impossible. The basic requirements of the python language require a minimum entry-level, and we try to solve this problem at this stage also, either as a separate warm-up or otherwise.

## How to learn
'How to learn?' is the biggest concern of readers, but also the author needs to solve it. We built the system's resource platform to meet the necessary data acquisition, code operation, interactive discussion to assist active learning. And the most critical is how to explain, which will continue to experiment in this stage, adjust to meet the requirements, and is also related to the feedback of partners in the community.

At this point, because the book is being written, we can adapt flexibly, because there are environmental genes for learning together, rather than reading alone at night. This experience of growing together will resonate with the reader and author, and we believe that the interaction of the community will stimulate the interest and passion for learning.
