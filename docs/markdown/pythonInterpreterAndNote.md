# Python interpreter and notes
'To do a good job, you have to use a good coder,' which includes not only python interpreters, but also the tools that a coder can use to survive as a newcomer. Code is the tool, but the soul is the solution. As a tool, there are many libraries and methods provided by them, besides python's own function.  The answer to the problem is not limited to one, as you swim in the lake of code, absorb this nutrient, and apply it to their problem-solving logic. After you have written tens of millions of lines of code, you will often look back and find that you cannot remember which ones you applied, or which library methods were used to solve which problems. When another problem demanded the same solution, the vague impression could not find where the original settlement had appeared and had to search again. It is why every coder has his or her codebase, just as this book's code is hosted on GitHub, where you can search, and transfer applications as needed.

## python interpreter
The code for this book is almost entirely implemented in Anaconda(open-source python package manager), using spyder and JupyterLab(interactive note, with support for many languages).

NO. |interpreter name| free or not|recommendation|
------------ |:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
1 |[python official](https://www.python.org/downloads/)|free|**Not recommended**，but lightweight, installable, occasionally used for easy code validation, or even as a calculator.| 
2 |[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)|Individual Edition free；<em>Team Edition and Enterprise Edition pay</em> |Integration of many science packages and their dependencies. ，**highly recommended**， because solving dependencies on your own can be quite frustrating.|
3 |[Visual Studio Code(VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)|free|**Recommended**，very convenient for viewing code, and support a variety of language formats. At the same time, this book uses docsify to deploy the web version, that is, VSC implementation.|
4 |[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)|pay|**generally recommended**，Usually used when deploying web pages, this book uses this platform in the deployment section of an experimental Web Application Platform.|
5 |[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)|free|Only used to view code, text editing, ** recommended use**， lightweight plain text code editor, can be used for code view, exceptionally compatible with many file formats. Try using this editor when some files are scrambled.|

## Notes
The purpose of taking notes is to sort out the knowledge and view it, classified as online(cloud) and local. Most editors work both locally and online because each has multiple electronic devices and needs to switch between platforms, rather than carrying everything with them. At the same time, to facilitate the collaboration of numerous people, which require sharing could environment. Besides, devices are sometimes lost, let alone broken to the point that they cannot be repaired. The combination of could and local is the best choice. It takes years of painstaking work to code and records the experimental research. If the data is lost due to equipment problems, it is an unbearable loss for individuals. Therefore, the partners in the work, especially the research scholars, must take precautions.

During the coding process of this book, using [GitHub](https://github.com/richieBao) managed code and wrote markdown documentation. Use GitHub Desktop to push and pull code and documents, both local and cloud.  Sometimes [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) is used to write markdown documents directly to the cloud. You can also edit directly online on GitHub.

To learn the code and be able to run the verification code interactively and simultaneously record instructions, you can use [JupyterLba or Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). This method is more suitable for teaching and communication. When the project is complicated and vast, the application of Jupyter tools can significantly reduce efficiency, meanwhile, not ideal for building code structure hierarchy. The code is still written in the spyder under Anaconda. Another tool, [VNote](https://tamlok.github.io/vnote/en_us/), for writing markdown documents in local is recommended for reference only.

Everyone has their habit of taking notes and taking notes of code is different from what we usually do with tools like OneNote. Highlight the code format, it is best to run it and see the results, so you need to choose a note-taking tool base on your situation to make learning the code a lot easier.
